# 4 The Personality of the Holy Spirit

### by C.H. Spurgeon

January 21, 1855

> “And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you forever: even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it sees him not, neither knows him: but you know him for he dwells with you, and shall be in you.”  
— *John 14:16-17*

You will be surprised to hear me announce that I do not intend this morning to say anything about the Holy Spirit as the Comforter. I propose to reserve that for a special Sermon this evening. In this discourse, I shall endeavor to explain and enforce certain other doctrines which I believe are plainly taught in this text and which I hope God the Holy Ghost may make profitable to our souls. Old John Newton once said that there were some books which he could not read, they were good and sound enough, but, said he, “They are books of halfpence—you have to take so much in quantity before you have any value, there are other books of silver and others of gold, but I have one book that is a book of bank notes, and every leaf is a bank note of immense value.” So I found with this text, that I had a bank note of so large a sum that I could not tell it out all this morning. I should have to keep you several hours, before I could unfold to you the whole value of this precious promise—one of the last which Christ gave to His people.

I invite your attention to this passage because we shall find in it some instruction on four points, first, concerning *the true and proper personality of the Holy Ghost,* secondly, concerning *the united agency of the glorious Three Persons in the work of our salvation,* thirdly, we shall find *something to establish the doctrine of the indwelling of the Holy Ghost in the souls of all believers,* and fourthly, we shall find out *the reason why the carnal mind rejects the Holy Ghost.*

First of all, we shall have some little instruction concerning the proper PERSONALITY OF THE HOLY SPIRIT.

We are so much accustomed to talk about the influence of the Holy Ghost and His sacred operations and graces that we are apt to forget that the Holy Spirit is truly and actually a person—that He is a subsistence—an existence, or as we Trinitarians usually say, one person in the essence of the Godhead. I am afraid that, though we do not know it, we have acquired the habit of regarding the Holy Ghost as an emanation flowing from the Father and the Son, but not as being actually a person Himself. I know it is not easy to carry about in our mind the idea of the Holy Spirit as a person. I can think of the Father as a person, because His acts are such as I can understand. I see Him hang the world in ether, I behold Him swaddling a newborn sea in bands of darkness, I know it is He who formed the drops of hail, who leads forth the stars by their hosts and calls them by their name, I can conceive of Him as a person because I behold His operations. I can realize Jesus, the Son of Man, as a real person because He is bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh. It takes no great stretch of my imagination to picture the babe in Bethlehem, or to behold the “Man of sorrows and acquainted with grief,” of the King of martyrs, as He was persecuted in Pilate’s hall, or nailed to the accursed tree for our sins. Nor do I find it difficult at times to realize the person of my Jesus sitting on His throne in heaven, or girt with clouds and wearing the diadem of all creation, calling the earth to judgment and summoning us to hear our final sentence. But when I come to deal with the Holy Ghost, His operations are so mysterious, His doings are so secret, His acts are so removed from everything that is of sense, and of the body, that I cannot so easily get the idea of His being a person, but a person He is. God the Holy Ghost is not an influence, an emanation, a stream of something flowing from the Father, but He is as much an actual person as either God the Son, or God the Father. I shall attempt this morning a little to establish the doctrine and to show you the truth of it—that God the Holy Spirit is actually a person.

The first proof we shall gather from the pool of holy baptism. Let me take you down, as I have taken others, into the pool, now concealed, but which I wish were always open to your view. Let me take you to the baptismal font, where believers put on the name of the Lord Jesus, and you shall hear me pronounce the solemn words, “I baptize you in the name,”—mark, “in the name,” not names—“of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.” Everyone who is baptized according to the true form laid down in Scripture must be a Trinitarian, otherwise his baptism is a farce and a lie, and he himself is found a deceiver and a hypocrite before God. As the Father is mentioned and as the Son is mentioned, so is the Holy Ghost, and the whole is summed up as being a Trinity in unity, by its being said, not the names, but the “name” the glorious name, the Jehovah name, “of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.” Let me remind you that the same thing occurs each time you are dismissed from this house of prayer. In pronouncing the solemn closing benediction, we invoke on your behalf the love of Jesus Christ, the grace of the Father and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, and thus, according to the apostolic manner, we make a manifest distinction between the persons, showing that we believe the Father to be a person, the Son to be a person, and the Holy Ghost to be a person. Were there no other proofs in Scripture, I think these would be sufficient for every sensible man. He would see that if the Holy Spirit were a mere influence, He would not be mentioned in conjunction with two whom we all confess to be actual and proper persons.

A second argument arises from the fact that the Holy Ghost has actually made different appearances on earth. The Great Spirit has manifested Himself to man, He has put on a form so that while He has not been beheld by mortal men, He has been so veiled in appearance that He was seen, so far as that appearance was concerned, by the eyes of all beholders. Do you see Jesus Christ our Savior? There is the river Jordan, with its shelving banks and its willows weeping at its side. Jesus Christ, the Son of God, descends into the stream and the holy Baptist, John, plunges Him into the waves. The doors of heaven are opened, a miraculous appearance presents itself, a bright light shines from the sky, brighter than the sun in all its grandeur, and down in a flood of glory descends something which you recognize to be a dove. It rests on Jesus—it sits upon His sacred head, and as the old painters put a halo round the brow of Jesus, so did the Holy Ghost shed a resplendence around the face of Him who came to fulfill all righteousness and therefore commenced with the ordinances of baptism. The Holy Ghost was seen as a dove, to mark His purity and His gentleness, and He came down like a dove *from heaven* to show that it is from heaven alone that He descends.

Nor is this the only time when the Holy Ghost has been manifest in a visible shape. You see that company of disciples gathered together in an upper room, they are waiting for some promised blessing, by and by it shall come. Hark! there is a sound as of a rushing mighty wind, it fills all the house where they are sitting, and astonished, they look around them, wondering what will come next. Soon a bright light appears, shining upon the heads of each, cloven tongues of fire sat upon them. What were these marvelous appearances of wind and flame but a display of the Holy Ghost in His proper person? I say the fact of an appearance manifests that He must be a person. An influence could not appear—an attribute could not appear, we cannot see attributes—we cannot behold influences. The Holy Ghost must then have been a person, since He was beheld by mortal eyes, and came under the cognizance of mortal sense.

Another proof is from the fact that personal qualities are, in Scripture, ascribed to the Holy Ghost. First, let me read to you a text in which the Holy Ghost is spoken of as having *understanding.* In the first Epistle to the Corinthians, chapter two, you will read, “But as it is written, Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God has prepared for them that love him. But God has revealed them unto us by His Spirit, for the Spirit searches all things, yes, the deep things of God. For what man knows the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knows no man, but the Spirit of God.” Here you see an understanding—a power of knowledge is ascribed to the Holy Ghost. Now, if there be any persons here whose minds are of so preposterous a complexion that they would ascribe one attribute to another, and would speak of a mere influence having understanding, then I give up all the argument. But I believe every rational man will admit that when anything is spoken of as having an understanding, it must be an existence—it must, in fact, be a person. In the twelfth chapter, eleventh verse of the same Epistle, you will find a *will* ascribed to the Holy Spirit. “But all these work that one and the self same Spirit, dividing to every man severally as He will.” So it is plain the Spirit has a will. He does not come from God simply at God’s will, but He has a will of His own, which is always in keeping with the will of the infinite Jehovah, but is, nevertheless, distinct and separate, Therefore I say He is a Person. In another text *power* is ascribed to the Holy Ghost and power is a thing which can only be ascribed to an existence. In Romans 15:13, it is written, “Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that you may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost.” I need not insist upon it, because it is self-evident, that wherever you find understanding, will, and power, you must also find an existence, it cannot be a mere attribute, it cannot be a metaphor, it cannot be a personified influence, but it must be a person.

But I have a proof which, perhaps, will be more telling upon you than any other. Acts and deeds are ascribed to the Holy Ghost, therefore He must be a person. You read in the first chapter of the Book of Genesis, that the Spirit brooded over the surface of the earth, when it was as yet all disorder and confusion. This world was once a mass of chaotic matter, there was no order, it was like the valley of darkness and of the shadow of death. God the Holy Ghost spread His wings over it, He sowed the seeds of life in it, the germs from which all beings sprang were implanted by Him, He impregnated the earth so that it became capable of life. Now it must have been a person who brought order out of confusion, it must have been an existence who hovered over this world and made it what it now is.

But do we not read in Scripture something more of the Holy Ghost? Yes, we are told that “Holy men of old spoke as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.” When Moses penned the Pentateuch, the Holy Ghost moved his hand, when David wrote the Psalms and discoursed sweet music on his harp, it was the Holy Spirit that gave his fingers their Seraphic motion, when Solomon dropped from his lips the words of the Proverbs of wisdom, or when he hymned the Canticles of love, it was the Holy Ghost who gave him words of knowledge and hymns of rapture. Ah! and what fire was that which touched the lips of the eloquent Isaiah? What hand was that which came upon Daniel? What might was that which made Jeremiah so plaintive in his grief? or what was that which winged Ezekiel, and made him like an eagle, soar into mysteries aloft and see the mighty unknown beyond our reach? Who was it that made Amos, the herdsman, a prophet? Who taught the rough Haggai to pronounce his thundering sentences? Who showed Habakkuk the horses of Jehovah marching through the waters? or who kindled the burning eloquence of Nahum? Who caused Malachi to close up the book with the muttering of the word curse? Who was in each of these, save the Holy Ghost? And must it not have been a person who spoke in and through these ancient witnesses? We must believe it. We cannot avoid believing it, when we recall that “Holy men of old spoke as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.”

And when has the Holy Ghost ceased to have an influence upon men? We find that still He deals with His ministers and with all His saints. Turn to the Acts and you will find that the Holy Ghost said, “Separate me Paul and Barnabas for the work.” I never heard of an attribute saying such a thing. The Holy Spirit said to Peter, “Go to the centurion and what I have cleansed, that call not you common.” The Holy Ghost caught away Philip after he had baptized the eunuch and carried him to another place, and the Holy Ghost said to Paul, “You shall not go into that city, but shall turn into another.” And we know that the Holy Ghost was lied unto by Ananias and Sapphira, when it was said, “You have not lied unto man, but unto God.” Again, that power which we feel every day who are called to preach—that wondrous spell which makes our lips so potent—that power which gives us thoughts which are like birds from a far-off region, not the natives of our soul—that influence which I sometimes strangely feel, which, if it does not give me poetry and eloquence, gives me a might I never felt before, and lifts me above my fellow man—that majesty with which He clothes His ministers, till in the midst of the battle  they cry, aha! like the war-horse of Job, and move themselves like leviathans in the water—that power which gives us might over men, and causes them to sit and listen as if their ears were chained, as if they were entranced by the power of some magician’s wand—that power must come from a person, it must come from the Holy Ghost.

But is it not said in Scripture, and do we not feel it, dear brethren, that it is the Holy Ghost who regenerates the soul? It is the Holy Ghost who quickens us. “You has He quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins.” It is the Holy Spirit who imparts the first germ of life, convincing us of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment to come. And is it not the Holy Spirit who after that flame is kindled, still fans it with the breath of His mouth and keeps it alive? Its author is its preserver. Oh! can it be said that it is the Holy Ghost who strives in men’s souls, that it is the Holy Ghost who brings them to the foot of Sinai, and then guides them into the sweet place that is called Calvary—can it be said that He does all these things and yet is not a person? It may be said, but it must be said by fools, for he never can be a wise man who can consider that these things can be done by any other than a glorious person—a divine existence.

Allow me to give you one more proof and I shall have done. Certain feelings are ascribed to the Holy Ghost which can only be understood upon the supposition that He is actually a person. In the fourth chapter of Ephesians, verse thirty, it is said that the Holy Ghost can be grieved, “Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby you are sealed unto the day of redemption.” In Isaiah 63:10 it is said that the Holy Ghost can be vexed, “But they rebelled, and vexed His Holy Spirit: therefore he was turned to be their enemy, and he fought against them.” In Acts 7:51, you read that the Holy Ghost can be resisted, “You stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, you do always resist the Holy Ghost: as your fathers did, so do you.” And in the fifth chapter, ninth verse of the same book, you will find that the Holy Ghost may be tempted. We are there informed that Peter said to Ananias and Sapphira, “How is it that you have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord?” Now, these things could not be emotions which might be ascribed to a quality or an emanation, they must be understood to relate to a person, an influence could not be grieved, it must be a person who can be grieved, vexed, or resisted.

And now, dear brethren, I think I have fully established the point of the personality of the Holy Ghost, allow me now, most earnestly, to impress upon you the absolute necessity of being sound upon the doctrine of the Trinity. I knew a man, a good minister of Jesus Christ he is now, and I believe he was before he turned aside unto heresy—he began to doubt the glorious divinity of our blessed Lord, and for years he preached the heterodox doctrine, until one day he happened to hear a very eccentric old minister preaching from the text, “But there the *glorious LORD* will be unto us a place of broad rivers and streams; wherein shall go no galley with oars, neither shall gallant ship pass thereby…Your tacklings are loosed; they could not well strengthen their mast, they could not spread the sail.” “Now,” said the old minister, “you give up the Trinity and your tacklings are loosed, you cannot strengthen your masts. Once give up the doctrine of three persons and your tacklings are all gone, your mast, which ought to be a support to your vessel, is a rickety one and shakes.”

A Gospel without a Trinity!—it is a pyramid built upon its apex. A Gospel without the Trinity!—it is a rope of sand that cannot hold together. A Gospel without the Trinity!—then, indeed, Satan can overturn it. But, give me a Gospel with the Trinity, and the might of hell cannot prevail against it; no man can any more overthrow it than a bubble could split a rock, or a feather break in halves a mountain. Get the thought of the three persons and you have the marrow of all divinity. Only know the Father, and know the Son, and know the Holy Ghost to be One, and all things will appear clear. This is the golden key to the secrets of nature, this is the silken clue of the labyrinths of mystery, and he who understands this, will soon understand as much as mortals e’er can know.
