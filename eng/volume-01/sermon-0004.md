# 4 The Personality of the Holy Spirit

### by C.H. Spurgeon

January 21, 1855

> “And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you forever: even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it sees him not, neither knows him: but you know him for he dwells with you, and shall be in you.”  
— *John 14:16-17*

You will be surprised to hear me announce that I do not intend this morning to say anything about the Holy Spirit as the Comforter. I propose to reserve that for a special Sermon this evening. In this discourse, I shall endeavor to explain and enforce certain other doctrines which I believe are plainly taught in this text and which I hope God the Holy Ghost may make profitable to our souls. Old John Newton once said that there were some books which he could not read, they were good and sound enough, but, said he, “They are books of halfpence—you have to take so much in quantity before you have any value, there are other books of silver and others of gold, but I have one book that is a book of bank notes, and every leaf is a bank note of immense value.” So I found with this text, that I had a bank note of so large a sum that I could not tell it out all this morning. I should have to keep you several hours, before I could unfold to you the whole value of this precious promise—one of the last which Christ gave to His people.

I invite your attention to this passage because we shall find in it some instruction on four points, first, concerning *the true and proper personality of the Holy Ghost,* secondly, concerning *the united agency of the glorious Three Persons in the work of our salvation,* thirdly, we shall find *something to establish the doctrine of the indwelling of the Holy Ghost in the souls of all believers,* and fourthly, we shall find out *the reason why the carnal mind rejects the Holy Ghost.*
