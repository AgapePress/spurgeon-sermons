> “This do in remembrance of me.”  
— *1 Corinthians 11:24*

It seems, then, that Christians may forget Christ. The text implies the possibility of forgetfulness concerning Him whom gratitude and affection should constrain them to remember. There could be no need for this loving exhortation if there were not a fearful supposition that our memories might prove treacherous, and our remembrance superficial in its character, or changing in its nature. Nor is this a bare supposition, it is, alas, too well confirmed in our experience, not as a possibility, but as a lamentable fact. It seems at first sight too gross a crime to lay at the door of converted men. It appears almost impossible that those who have been redeemed by the blood of the dying Lamb should ever forget their Ransomer, that those who have been loved with an everlasting love by the eternal Son of God, should ever forget that Son, but if startling to the ear, it is alas, too apparent to the eye to allow us to deny the fact. Forget Him who ne’er forgot us! Forget Him who poured His blood forth for our sins! Forget Him who loved us even to the death! Can it be possible? Yes it is not only possible, but conscience confesses that it is too sadly a fault of all of us, that we can remember anything except Christ. The object which we should make the monarch of our hearts is the very thing we are most inclined to forget. Where one would think that memory would linger, and unmindfulness would be an unknown intruder, that is the very spot which is desecrated by the feet of forgetfulness, and the place where memory too seldom looks.

I appeal to the conscience of every Christian here. Can you deny the truth of what I utter? Do you not find yourselves forgetful of Jesus? Some creature steals away your heart and you are unmindful of Him upon whom your affection ought to be set. Some earthly business engrosses your attention when you should have your eye steadily fixed upon the cross. It is the incessant round of world, world, world, the constant din of earth, earth, earth, that takes away the soul from Christ. Oh! my friends, is it not too sadly true that we can recollect anything but Christ and forget nothing so easy as Him whom we ought to remember? While memory will preserve a poisoned weed, it suffers the Rose of Sharon to wither.

The cause of this is very apparent; it lies in one or two facts. We forget Christ, because regenerate persons as we really are, still corruption and death remain even in us. We forget Him because we carry about with us the old Adam of sin and death. If we were purely new-born creatures, we would never forget the name of Him whom we love. If we were entirely regenerated beings, we should sit down and meditate on what our Savior did and suffered, all He is, all He has gloriously promised to perform, and never would our roving affections stray, but centered, nailed, fixed eternally to one object, we should continually contemplate the death and sufferings of our Lord. But alas! we have a worm in the heart, a pest-house, a charnel-house within, lusts, vile imaginations, and strong evil passions, which, like wells of poisonous water, send out continually streams of impurity. I have a heart, which God knows, I wish I could wring from my body and hurl to an infinite distance, a soul which is a cage of unclean birds, a den of loathsome creatures, where dragons haunt and owls do congregate, where every evil beast of ill-omen dwells, a heart too vile to have a parallel—“deceitful above all things and desperately wicked.” This is the reason why I am forgetful of Christ. Nor is this the sole cause, I suspect it lies somewhere else too. We forget Christ because there are so many other things around us to attract our attention. “But,” you say, “they ought not to do so, because though they are around us, they are nothing in comparison with Jesus Christ, though they are in dread proximity to our hearts, what are they compared with Christ?” But do you know, dear friends, that the nearness of an object has a very great effect upon its power? The sun is many, many times larger than the moon, but the moon has a greater influence upon the tides of the ocean than the sun, simply because it is nearer, and has a greater power of attraction. So I find that a little crawling worm of the earth has more effect upon my soul than the glorious Christ in heaven, a handful of golden earth, a puff of fame, a shout of applause, a thriving business, my house, my home, will affect me more than all the glories of the upper world, yes, than the beatific vision itself, simply because earth is near and heaven is far away. Happy day, when I shall be borne aloft on angels’ wings to dwell forever near my Lord; to bask in the sunshine of His smile, and to be lost in the ineffable radiance of His lovely countenance. We see then the cause of forgetfulness, let us blush over it, let us be sad that we neglect our Lord so much, and now let us attend to His word, “This do in remembrance of Me,” hoping that its solemn sounds may charm away the demon of base ingratitude.

We shall speak, first of all, concerning *the blessed object of memory,* secondly, upon *the advantages to be derived from remembering this Person,* thirdly the *gracious help, to our memory*—“This do in *remembrance* of *Me*,” and fourthly, *the gentle command,* *“This do* in remembrance of me.” May the Holy Ghost open my lips and your hearts, that we may receive blessings.

First of all, we shall speak of THE GLORIOUS AND PRECIOUS OBJECT OF MEMORY—
“This do in remembrance of *me*.”

Christians have many treasures to lock up in the cabinet of memory. They ought to remember their *election*—“Chosen of God ere time began.” They ought to be mindful of their *extraction*, that they were taken out of the miry clay, hewn out of the horrible pit. They ought to recollect their *effectual calling*, for they were called of God and rescued by the power of the Holy Ghost. They ought to remember their *special deliverances*—all that has been done for them and all the mercies bestowed on them. But there is one, whom they should embalm in their souls with the most costly spices—one who, above all other gifts of God, deserves to be had in perpetual remembrance. *One* I said, for I mean not an act, I mean not a deed, but it is a Person whose portrait I would frame in gold and hang up in the state-room of the soul. I would have you earnest students of all the *deeds* of the conquering Messiah. I would have you conversant with the *life* of our Beloved. But O forget not His *person*, for the text says, “This do in remembrance of ME.” It is Christ’s glorious person which ought to be the object of our remembrance. It is His image which should be enshrined in every temple of the Holy Ghost.
