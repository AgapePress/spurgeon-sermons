# 2 The Remembrance of Christ

> “This do in remembrance of me.”  
— *1 Corinthians 11:24*

It seems, then, that Christians may forget Christ. The text implies the possibility of forgetfulness concerning Him whom gratitude and affection should constrain them to remember. There could be no need for this loving exhortation if there were not a fearful supposition that our memories might prove treacherous, and our remembrance superficial in its character, or changing in its nature. Nor is this a bare supposition, it is, alas, too well confirmed in our experience, not as a possibility, but as a lamentable fact. It seems at first sight too gross a crime to lay at the door of converted men. It appears almost impossible that those who have been redeemed by the blood of the dying Lamb should ever forget their Ransomer, that those who have been loved with an everlasting love by the eternal Son of God, should ever forget that Son, but if startling to the ear, it is alas, too apparent to the eye to allow us to deny the fact. Forget Him who ne’er forgot us! Forget Him who poured His blood forth for our sins! Forget Him who loved us even to the death! Can it be possible? Yes it is not only possible, but conscience confesses that it is too sadly a fault of all of us, that we can remember anything except Christ. The object which we should make the monarch of our hearts is the very thing we are most inclined to forget. Where one would think that memory would linger, and unmindfulness would be an unknown intruder, that is the very spot which is desecrated by the feet of forgetfulness, and the place where memory too seldom looks.
